# How to reproduce the main part of the analysis?

Source **analysis.R**. Be warned that computations are time consuming.

# How to generate results and plots for publication?

Run **analysis_publication.R**. This step can be executed even without performing the full analysis, because the partial results are avaible in the repository.
