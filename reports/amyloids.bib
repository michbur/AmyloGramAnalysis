	abstract = {Analyses of amyloidogenic sequence fragments are essential in studies of neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is no one internet dataset that collects all the sequences that have been investigated for their amyloidogenicity. Therefore, we have created the AmyLoad website which collects the amyloidogenic sequences from all major sources. The website allows for filtration of the fragments and provides detailed information about each of them. Registered users can both personalize their work with the website and submit their own sequences into the database. To maintain database reliability, submitted sequences are reviewed before making them available to the public. Finally, we re-implemented several amyloidogenic sequence predictors, thus the AmyLoad website can be used as a sequence analysis tool. We encourage researchers working on amyloid proteins to contribute to our service.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The AmyLoad website is freely available at http://comprec-lin.iiar.pwr.edu.pl/amyload/.

Protein aggregation is a highly complex process resulting in a variety of aggregates with different structures and morphologies. Oligomeric protein aggregates (amyloid oligomers) are formed as both intermediates and final products of the aggregation process. They are believed to play an important role in many protein aggregation-related diseases, and many of them are highly cytotoxic. Due to their instability and structural heterogeneity, information about structure, mechanism of formation, and physiological effects of amyloid oligomers is sparse.

We investigated characteristics of contact sites in a representative set of proteins and their relations between protein class or topology. For this purpose, we used a non-redundant set of 5872 protein domains, identically categorized by CATH and SCOP databases. The proteins represented alpha, beta, and alpha+beta classes. Contact maps of protein structures were obtained for a selected set of physical distances in the main backbone and separations in protein sequences. For each set a dependency between contact degree and distance parameters was quantified. We indicated residues forming contact sites most frequently and unique amino acid pairs which created contact sites most often within each structural class. Contact characteristics of specific topologies were compared to the characteristics of their protein classes showing protein groups with a distinguished contact characteristic. We showed that our results could be used to improve the performance of recent top contact predictor — direct coupling analysis. Our work provides values of contact site propensities that can be involved in bioinformatic databases.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Amyloidogenic regions in polypeptide chains are very important because such regions are responsible for amyloid formation and aggregation. It is useful to be able to predict positions of amyloidogenic regions in protein chains.
RESULTS: Two characteristics (expected probability of hydrogen bonds formation and expected packing density of residues) have been introduced by us to detect amyloidogenic regions in a protein sequence. We demonstrate that regions with high expected probability of the formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds as well as regions with high expected packing density are mostly responsible for the formation of amyloid fibrils. Our method (FoldAmyloid) has been tested on a dataset of 407 peptides (144 amyloidogenic and 263 non-amyloidogenic peptides) and has shown good performance in predicting a peptide status: amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic. The prediction based on the expected packing density classified correctly 75\% of amyloidogenic peptides and 74\% of non-amyloidogenic ones. Two variants (averaging by donors and by acceptors) of prediction based on the probability of formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds gave a comparable efficiency. With a hybrid-scale constructed by merging the above three scales, our method is correct for 80\% of amyloidogenic peptides and for 72\% of non-amyloidogenic ones. Prediction of amyloidogenic regions in proteins where positions of amyloidogenic regions are known from experimental data has also been done. In the proteins, our method correctly finds 10 out of 11 amyloidogenic regions.

The propensities of different protein sequences to aggregate into amyloids, how they are enhanced by pathogenic mutations, the presence of aggregation hot spots stabilizing pathological interactions, the establishing of cross-amyloid interactions between co-aggregating proteins, all rely at the molecular level on the stability of the amyloid cross-beta structure. Our redesigned server, PASTA 2.0, provides a versatile platform where all of these different features can be easily predicted on a genomic scale given input sequences. The server provides other pieces of information, such as intrinsic disorder and secondary structure predictions, that complement the aggregation data. The PASTA 2.0 energy function evaluates the stability of putative cross-beta pairings between different sequence stretches. It was re-derived on a larger dataset of globular protein domains. The resulting algorithm was benchmarked on comprehensive peptide and protein test sets, leading to improved, state-of-the-art results with more amyloid forming regions correctly detected at high specificity.

This has lead to the development of several computational approaches to predict amyloidogenicity by amino acid sequences. Here, we discuss the principles governing these methods, and evaluate them using several datasets. They deliver excellent performance in the tests made using short peptides (∼6 residues). However, there is a general tendency towards a high number of false positives when tested against longer sequences. This shortcoming needs to be addressed as these longer sequences are linked to diseases. Recent structural studies have shown that the core element of the majority of disease-related amyloid fibrils is a β-strand-loop-β-strand motif called β-arch. This insight provides an opportunity to substantially improve the prediction of amyloids produced by natural proteins, ushering in an era of personalized medicine based on genome analysis.},
