The website allows for filtration of the fragments and provides detailed information about each of them. Registered users can both personalize their work with the website and submit their own sequences into the database. To maintain database reliability, submitted sequences are reviewed before making them available to the public. Finally, we re-implemented several amyloidogenic sequence predictors, thus the AmyLoad website can be used as a sequence analysis tool. We encourage researchers working on amyloid proteins to contribute to our service.

Contact maps of protein structures were obtained for a selected set of physical distances in the main backbone and separations in protein sequences. For each set a dependency between contact degree and distance parameters was quantified. We indicated residues forming contact sites most frequently and unique amino acid pairs which created contact sites most often within each structural class. Contact characteristics of specific topologies were compared to the characteristics of their protein classes showing protein groups with a distinguished contact characteristic. We showed that our results could be used to improve the performance of recent top contact predictor — direct coupling analysis.

The propensities of different protein sequences to aggregate into amyloids, how they are enhanced by pathogenic mutations, the presence of aggregation hot spots stabilizing pathological interactions, the establishing of cross-amyloid interactions between co-aggregating proteins, all rely at the molecular level on the stability of the amyloid cross-beta structure. Our redesigned server, PASTA 2.0, provides a versatile platform where all of these different features can be easily predicted on a genomic scale given input sequences. The server provides other pieces of information, such as intrinsic disorder and secondary structure predictions, that complement the aggregation data. The PASTA 2.0 energy function evaluates the stability of putative cross-beta pairings between different sequence stretches. It was re-derived on a larger dataset of globular protein domains. The resulting algorithm was benchmarked on comprehensive peptide and protein test sets, leading to improved, state-of-the-art results with more amyloid forming regions correctly detected at high specificity.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Amyloidogenic regions in polypeptide chains are very important because such regions are responsible for amyloid formation and aggregation. It is useful to be able to predict positions of amyloidogenic regions in protein chains.
RESULTS: Two characteristics (expected probability of hydrogen bonds formation and expected packing density of residues) have been introduced by us to detect amyloidogenic regions in a protein sequence. We demonstrate that regions with high expected probability of the formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds as well as regions with high expected packing density are mostly responsible for the formation of amyloid fibrils. Our method (FoldAmyloid) has been tested on a dataset of 407 peptides (144 amyloidogenic and 263 non-amyloidogenic peptides) and has shown good performance in predicting a peptide status: amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic. The prediction based on the expected packing density classified correctly 75\% of amyloidogenic peptides and 74\% of non-amyloidogenic ones. Two variants (averaging by donors and by acceptors) of prediction based on the probability of formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds gave a comparable efficiency. With a hybrid-scale constructed by merging the above three scales, our method is correct for 80\% of amyloidogenic peptides and for 72\% of non-amyloidogenic ones. Prediction of amyloidogenic regions in proteins where positions of amyloidogenic regions are known from experimental data has also been done. In the proteins, our method correctly finds 10 out of 11 amyloidogenic regions.

The contribution of each property to the sequence arrangement was derived. A hydrophobic core sequence was found in all signal peptides investigated. The structural arrangement of the cleavage site was also clearly revealed by this study. Most of the physical properties of the individual sequences correlated (correlation coefficient approximately 0.4) very well with the average distribution. The preferred occupancy of amino acid residues in the signal and nascent sequences was also calculated and correlated with their property distribution. The periodic behaviour of the signal and nascent chains was revealed by calculating their hydrophobic moments for various repetitive conformations.

Here we measure the thermodynamic beta-sheet propensities of each of the twenty commonly occurring amino acids. A previously studied zinc-finger peptide was used as the host system in which amino acids were substituted into a guest site, a solvent-exposed position in an antiparallel beta-sheet. As these peptides are unfolded in the absence of bound metal but are folded in their presence, it is assumed that the thermodynamics of metal binding fully reflect peptide-folding energy. A competitive cobalt(II)-binding assay was used to determine these energies with high precision. The relative free energies correlate well with previously derived potential values based on statistical analysis of protein structures.

Improperly aligned sequences or unrelated sequences give rH near zero. By considering the observed frequency of amino acid replacements among related structures, a set of optimal matching hydrophobicities (OMHs) was derived. With this set of OMHs, significant correlation coefficients are calculated for similar three-dimensional structures, even though the two sequences contain few identical residues.

First, 72 of the physical properties were eliminated from further consideration because they did not pass statistical tests that they follow a normal distribution. Second, the remaining 116 physical properties of the amino acids were classified by a cluster analysis to eliminate duplications of highly correlated physical properties. This led to nine clusters, each of which was characterized by an average characteristic property, namely bulk, two hydrophobicity indices for free amino acids, one hydrophobicity index for amino acid residues in a protein, two types of β-structure preference, α-helix preference, and two types of bend-structure preference. The physical properties within a given cluster were highly correlated with each other, but the correlation between clusters was low. Third, a factor analysis was applied to the nine average classified properties and 16 additional physical properties to obtain a small number of orthogonal properties (ten factors). Four of these factors arise from the nine characteristic properties, and the remaining six factors were obtained from the 16 physical properties not included in the nine characteristic properties. Finally, most of the 188 physical properties could be expressed as a sum of these ten orthogonal factors, with appropriate weighting factors. Since these factors contain information relating almost all properties of all 20 amino acids, it is possible to estimate the numerical values of a property for one or two amino acids for which experimental data for this property are not available. For example, the estimated values for the Zimm-Bragg parameters at 20°C are 0.66 and 0.92 for proline and cysteine, respectively, computed from the first four factors.},

This "comprehensive" parameter set is the first such reported. Parameters determined for the side chains of the standard 20 amino acids correlate well with those of widely accepted sets. Our parameters have also been evaluated by hydrophobicity profiles and by transverse hydrophobic moment calculations on cytosolic, secreted, and membranous model proteins, with favorable results. Many of the hydrophobicity parameters for the post- or cotranslationally modified derivatives are of remarkable magnitude, especially those for oligosaccharide-bound Asn and fatty-acylated Cys or amino terminus. Thus, the comprehensive parameter set determined here greatly extends our ability to analyze homology, membrane directedness, and folding potential of proteins.},

The equation is based on the assumption that Δhp log P and ΔGsol are all functions of the difference in intermolecular forces between the amino acid and some medium, and the amino acid and water. The parameters were chosen to model the intermolecular forces of interest. Generally the most important factor is αx. This is followed by ν, i, and nH. Least important is σI. ΔGsol depends on α, nH and nn. Hydration numbers depend on i, nH and nn. The hydrophobicity of amino acid side chains is the result of a preference for a nonpolar medium as a increases and for a polar medium as i, nH and σI increase. It is quantitatively accounted for by the model, and no special “hydrophobic bond” need be involved. The results show that log P values for amino acids are composite quantities whose composition is variable.},

	abstract = {Standard ranges of atomic and residue volumes are computed in 64 highly resolved and well-refined protein crystal structures using the classical Voronoi procedure. Deviations of the atomic volumes from the standard values, evaluated as the volumeZ-scores, are used to assess the quality of protein crystal structures. To score a structure globally, we compute the volumeZ-score root mean square deviation (Z-score rms), which measures the average magnitude of the volume irregularities in the structure. We find that theZ-score rms decreases as the resolution andR-factor improve, consistent with the fact that these improvements generally reflect more accurate models. From theZ-score rms distribution in structures with a given resolution orR-factor, we determine the normal limits inZ-score rms values for structures solved at that resolution orR-factor. Structures whoseZ-score rms exceeds these limits are considered as outliers. Such structures also exhibit unusual stereochemistry, as revealed by other analyses. AbsoluteZ-scores of individual atoms are used to identify problems in specific regions within a protein model. TheseZ-scores correlate fairly well with the atomicB-factors, and atoms having absoluteZ-scores \&gt;3, occur at or near regions in the model where programs such as PROCHECK identify unusual stereochemistry. Atomic volumes, themselves not directly restrained in crystallographic refinement, can thus provide an indepen dent, rather sensitive, measure of the quality of a protein structure. The volume-based structure validation procedures are implemented in the program PROVE (PROtein Volume Evaluation), which is accessible through the World Wide Web.},

	abstract = {The hydrophobicity scales for amino acid side chains based on the transfer Gibbs energy (DeltaG(trans)) of amino acids from non-aqueous phases to water have been widely used to estimate the contribution of buried side chains to the conformational stability of proteins. In this paper, we propose a new scale for the side-chain contribution to protein stability, which is derived from data on protein denaturation experiments using systematic and comprehensive mutant proteins. In the experiments, the contribution of some physical properties were quantitatively determined as parameters in a unique equation representing the stability change (DeltaDeltaG) of mutant proteins as a function of the structural changes due to the mutations. These parameters are able conveniently to provide a scale for the side-chain contribution to protein stability. This new scale also has the advantage over the previously reported hydrophobicity scales of residues with the contributions of hydrogen bonds or secondary structural propensity. It may find practical application in algorithms for the prediction of protein structures.},

	abstract = {The probability of occurrence of helix and β-sheet residues in 47 globular proteins was determined as a function of local hydrophobicity, which was defined by the sum of the Nozaki-Tanford transfer free energies at two nearest-neighbors on both sides of the amino acid sequence. In general, hydrophilic amino acids favor neither helix nor β-sheet formations when neighbor residues are also hydrophilic but favor helix formation at higher local hydrophobicity. On the other hand, some hydrophobic amino acids such as Met, Leu, and Ile favor helix formation when neighbor residues are hydrophilic. None of the hydrophobic amino acids favor β-sheet formation with hydrophilic neighbors, but most of them strongly favor β-sheet formation at high local hydrophobicity. When the average of 20 amino acids is taken, both helix and β-sheet residue probabilities are higher at higher local hydrophobicity, although the increase is steeper for β-sheets. Therefore, β-sheet formation is more influenced by local hydrophobicity than helix formation. Generally, helices are nearer the surface and tend to have hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces at opposite sides. The tendency of alternating regions of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues in a helical sequence was revealed by calculating the correlation of the Nozaki-Tanford values. Such amphipathic helices may be important in protein–protein and protein–lipid interactions and in forming hydrophilic channels in the membrane. The choice of 30 nonhomologous proteins as the data set did not alter the above results.},
