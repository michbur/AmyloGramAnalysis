Given n sets, this procedure permits their reduction to n − 1 mutually exclusive sets by considering the union of all possible n(n − 1)/2 pairs and selecting a union having a maximal value for the functional relation, or objective function, that reflects the criterion chosen by the investigator. By repeating this process until only one group remains, the complete hierarchical structure and a quantitative estimate of the loss associated with each stage in the grouping can be obtained.

	abstract = {Background
Amyloids are proteins capable of forming aberrant intramolecular contact sites, characteristic of beta zipper configuration. Amyloids can underlie serious health conditions, e.g. Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s diseases. It has been proposed that short segments of amino acids can be responsible for protein amyloidogenicity, but no more than two hundred such hexapeptides have been experimentally found. The authors of the computational tool Pafig published in BMC Bioinformatics a method for extending the amyloid hexapeptide dataset that could be used for training and testing models. They assumed that all hexapeptides belonging to an amyloid protein can be regarded as amylopositive, while those from proteins never reported as amyloid are always amylonegative. Here we show why the above described method of extending datasets is wrong and discuss the reasons why the incorrect data could lead to falsely correct classification.

Results
The amyloid classification of hexapeptides by Pafig was confronted with the classification results from different state of the art computational methods and the outputs of all methods were studied by clustering analysis. The clustering methods show that Pafig is an outlier with regard to other approaches. Our study of the statistical patterns of its training and testing datasets showed a strong bias towards STVIIE hexapeptide in their positive part. Different statistical patterns of seemingly amylo -positive and -negative hexapeptides allow for a repeatable classification, which is not related to amyloid propensity of the hexapetides.

Conclusions
Our study on recognition of amyloid hexapeptides showed that occurrence of incidental patterns in wrongly selected datasets can produce falsely correct results of classification. The assumption that all hexapeptides belonging to amyloid protein can be regarded as amylopositive and those from proteins never reported as amyloid are always amylonegative is not supported by any other computational method. This is in line with experimental observations that amyloid propensity of a full protein can result from only one amyloidogenic fragment in this protein, while the occurrence of amyliodogenic part that is well hidden inside the protein may never lead to fibril formation. This leads to the conclusion that Pafig does not provide correct classification with regard to amyloidogenicity.},

The preface to the 2nd Edition stated that “the most important omission is an adequate treatment of optimality paralleling that given for estimation in TPE.” We shall here remedy this failure by treating the di?cult topic of asymptotic optimality (in Chapter 13) together with the large-sample tools needed for this purpose (in Chapters 11 and 12). Having developed these tools, we use them in Chapter 14 to give a much fuller treatment of tests of goodness of ?t than was possible in the 2nd Edition, and in Chapter 15 to provide an introduction to the bootstrap and related techniques. Various large-sample considerations that in the Second Edition were discussed in earlier chapters now have been moved to Chapter 11.},

These parameters are able conveniently to provide a scale for the side-chain contribution to protein stability.

The analysis consisted of three main steps. First, 72 of the physical properties were eliminated from further consideration because they did not pass statistical tests that they follow a normal distribution. Second, the remaining 116 physical properties of the amino acids were classified by a cluster analysis to eliminate duplications of highly correlated physical properties. This led to nine clusters, each of which was characterized by an average characteristic property, namely bulk, two hydrophobicity indices for free amino acids, one hydrophobicity index for amino acid residues in a protein, two types of β-structure preference, α-helix preference, and two types of bend-structure preference. The physical properties within a given cluster were highly correlated with each other, but the correlation between clusters was low. Third, a factor analysis was applied to the nine average classified properties and 16 additional physical properties to obtain a small number of orthogonal properties (ten factors). Four of these factors arise from the nine characteristic properties, and the remaining six factors were obtained from the 16 physical properties not included in the nine characteristic properties. Finally, most of the 188 physical properties could be expressed as a sum of these ten orthogonal factors, with appropriate weighting factors. Since these factors contain information relating almost all properties of all 20 amino acids, it is possible to estimate the numerical values of a property for one or two amino acids for which experimental data for this property are not available. For example, the estimated values for the Zimm-Bragg parameters at 20°C are 0.66 and 0.92 for proline and cysteine, respectively, computed from the first four factors.},

Equally, a range of species formed by the same disease associated amyloid sequences have been found to be relatively benign under comparable monomer equivalent concentrations and conditions. In recent years, an increasing number of functional amyloid systems have also been found. These developments show that not all amyloid structures are generically toxic to cells. Given these observations, it is important to understand why amyloid structures may encode such varied toxic potential despite sharing a common core molecular architecture. Here, we discuss possible links between different aspects of amyloidogenic structures and assembly mechanisms with their varied functional effects.

	abstract = {The probability of occurrence of helix and β-sheet residues in 47 globular proteins was determined as a function of local hydrophobicity, which was defined by the sum of the Nozaki-Tanford transfer free energies at two nearest-neighbors on both sides of the amino acid sequence. In general, hydrophilic amino acids favor neither helix nor β-sheet formations when neighbor residues are also hydrophilic but favor helix formation at higher local hydrophobicity. On the other hand, some hydrophobic amino acids such as Met, Leu, and Ile favor helix formation when neighbor residues are hydrophilic. None of the hydrophobic amino acids favor β-sheet formation with hydrophilic neighbors, but most of them strongly favor β-sheet formation at high local hydrophobicity. When the average of 20 amino acids is taken, both helix and β-sheet residue probabilities are higher at higher local hydrophobicity, although the increase is steeper for β-sheets. Therefore, β-sheet formation is more influenced by local hydrophobicity than helix formation. Generally, helices are nearer the surface and tend to have hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces at opposite sides. The tendency of alternating regions of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues in a helical sequence was revealed by calculating the correlation of the Nozaki-Tanford values. Such amphipathic helices may be important in protein–protein and protein–lipid interactions and in forming hydrophilic channels in the membrane. The choice of 30 nonhomologous proteins as the data set did not alter the above results.},

Propensity scales for residues in alpha-helices have been generated through the use of various host-guest systems. Here we measure the thermodynamic beta-sheet propensities of each of the twenty commonly occurring amino acids. A previously studied zinc-finger peptide was used as the host system in which amino acids were substituted into a guest site, a solvent-exposed position in an antiparallel beta-sheet. As these peptides are unfolded in the absence of bound metal but are folded in their presence, it is assumed that the thermodynamics of metal binding fully reflect peptide-folding energy. A competitive cobalt(II)-binding assay was used to determine these energies with high precision. The relative free energies correlate well with previously derived potential values based on statistical analysis of protein structures. We are therefore able to present a thermodynamic beta-sheet propensity scale for all the commonly occurring amino acids in aqueous solution.},

A major factor is the presence in the protein of a segment that can form a tightly complementary interface with an identical segment, which permits the formation of a steric zipper—two self-complementary beta sheets that form the spine of an amyloid fibril. Another factor is sufficient conformational freedom of the self-complementary segment to interact with other molecules. Using RNase A as a model system, we validate our fibrillogenic predictions by the 3D profile method based on the crystal structure of NNQQNY and demonstrate that a specific residue order is required for fiber formation. Our genome-wide analysis revealed that self-complementary segments are found in almost all proteins, yet not all proteins form amyloids. The implication is that chaperoning effects have evolved to constrain self-complementary segments from interaction with each other.},

In addition, significant conformational heterogeneity is known or suspected to exist in many amyloid fibrils. Previous work has demonstrated that probability-based prediction of discrete β-strand pairs can offer insight into these structures. Here, we devise a system of energetic rules that can be used to dynamically assemble these discrete β-strand pairs into complete amyloid β-structures. The STITCHER algorithm progressively 'stitches' strand-pairs into full β-sheets based on a novel free-energy model, incorporating experimentally observed amino-acid side-chain stacking contributions, entropic estimates, and steric restrictions for amyloidal parallel β-sheet construction. A dynamic program computes the top 50 structures and returns both the highest scoring structure and a consensus structure taken by polling this list for common discrete elements. Putative structural heterogeneity can be inferred from sequence regions that compose poorly. Predictions show agreement with experimental models of Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide and the Podospora anserina Het-s prion. Predictions of the HET-s homolog HET-S also reflect experimental observations of poor amyloid formation. We put forward predicted structures for the yeast prion Sup35, suggesting N-terminal structural stability enabled by tyrosine ladders, and C-terminal heterogeneity. Predictions for the Rnq1 prion and alpha-synuclein are also given, identifying a similar mix of homogenous and heterogeneous secondary structure elements. STITCHER provides novel insight into the energetic basis of amyloid structure, provides accurate structure predictions, and can help guide future experimental studies.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Proteins of all kinds can self-assemble into highly ordered β-sheet aggregates known as amyloid fibrils, important both biologically and clinically. However, the specific molecular structure of a fibril can vary dramatically depending on sequence and environmental conditions, and mutations can drastically alter amyloid function and pathogenicity. Experimental structure determination has proven extremely difficult with only a handful of NMR-based models proposed, suggesting a need for computational methods. Results: We present AmyloidMutants, a statistical mechanics approach for de novo prediction and analysis of wild-type and mutant amyloid structures. Based on the premise of protein mutational landscapes, AmyloidMutants energetically quantifies the effects of sequence mutation on fibril conformation and stability. Tested on non-mutant, full-length amyloid structures with known chemical shift data, AmyloidMutants offers roughly 2-fold improvement in prediction accuracy over existing tools. Moreover, AmyloidMutants is the only method to predict complete super-secondary structures, enabling accurate discrimination of topologically dissimilar amyloid conformations that correspond to the same sequence locations. Applied to mutant prediction, AmyloidMutants identifies a global conformational switch between Aβ and its highly-toxic ‘Iowa’ mutant in agreement with a recent experimental model based on partial chemical shift data. Predictions on mutant, yeast-toxic strains of HET-s suggest similar alternate folds. When applied to HET-s and a HET-s mutant with core asparagines replaced by glutamines (both highly amyloidogenic chemically similar residues abundant in many amyloids), AmyloidMutants surprisingly predicts a greatly reduced capacity of the glutamine mutant to form amyloid. We confirm this finding by conducting mutagenesis experiments. Availability: Our tool is publically available on the web at http://amyloid.csail.mit.edu/.

We estimate that reduced alphabets containing 10–12 letters can be used to design foldable sequences for a large number of protein families. This estimate is based on the observation that there is little loss of the information necessary to pick out structural homologs in a clustered protein sequence database when a suitable reduction of the amino acid alphabet from 20 to 10 letters is made, but that this information is rapidly degraded when further reductions in the alphabet are made.},

Our present understanding on the molecular determinants of protein aggregation has crystalized in a series of predictive algorithms to identify aggregation-prone sites. A majority of these methods rely only on sequence. Therefore, they find difficulties to predict the aggregation properties of folded globular proteins, where aggregation-prone sites are often not contiguous in sequence or buried inside the native structure. The AGGRESCAN3D (A3D) server overcomes these limitations by taking into account the protein structure and the experimental aggregation propensity scale from the well-established AGGRESCAN method. Using the A3D server, the identified aggregation-prone residues can be virtually mutated to design variants with increased solubility, or to test the impact of pathogenic mutations. Additionally, A3D server enables to take into account the dynamic fluctuations of protein structure in solution, which may influence aggregation propensity. This is possible in A3D Dynamic Mode that exploits the CABS-flex approach for the fast simulations of flexibility of globular proteins.

The approach builds on experiments showing that hexapeptides are sufficient for forming amyloid-like fibrils. Each six-residue peptide of a protein of interest is mapped onto an ensemble of templates, or 3D profile, generated from the crystal structure of the peptide NNQQNY by small displacements of one of the two intermeshed beta-sheets relative to the other. The energy of each mapping of a sequence to the profile is evaluated by using ROSETTADESIGN, and the lowest energy match for a given peptide to the template library is taken as the putative prediction. If the energy of the putative prediction is lower than a threshold value, a prediction of fibril formation is made. This method can reach an accuracy of approximately 80\% with a P value of approximately 10(-12) when a conservative energy threshold is used to separate peptides that form fibrils from those that do not. We see enrichment for positive predictions in a set of fibril-forming segments of amyloid proteins, and we illustrate the method with applications to proteins of interest in amyloid research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein aggregation correlates with the development of several debilitating human disorders of growing incidence, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. On the biotechnological side, protein production is often hampered by the accumulation of recombinant proteins into aggregates. Thus, the development of methods to anticipate the aggregation properties of polypeptides is receiving increasing attention. AGGRESCAN is a web-based software for the prediction of aggregation-prone segments in protein sequences, the analysis of the effect of mutations on protein aggregation propensities and the comparison of the aggregation properties of different proteins or protein sets. RESULTS: AGGRESCAN is based on an aggregation-propensity scale for natural amino acids derived from in vivo experiments and on the assumption that short and specific sequence stretches modulate protein aggregation. The algorithm is shown to identify a series of protein fragments involved in the aggregation of disease-related proteins and to predict the effect of genetic mutations on their deposition propensities. It also provides new insights into the differential aggregation properties displayed by globular proteins, natively unfolded polypeptides, amyloidogenic proteins and proteins found in bacterial inclusion bodies. CONCLUSION: By identifying aggregation-prone segments in proteins, AGGRESCAN http://bioinf.uab.es/aggrescan/ shall facilitate (i) the identification of possible therapeutic targets for anti-depositional strategies in conformational diseases and (ii) the anticipation of aggregation phenomena during storage or recombinant production of bioactive polypeptides or polypeptide sets.},

We indicated residues forming contact sites most frequently and unique amino acid pairs which created contact sites most often within each structural class. Contact characteristics of specific topologies were compared to the characteristics of their protein classes showing protein groups with a distinguished contact characteristic. We showed that our results could be used to improve the performance of recent top contact predictor — direct coupling analysis. Our work provides values of contact site propensities that can be involved in bioinformatic databases.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Amyloidogenic regions in polypeptide chains are very important because such regions are responsible for amyloid formation and aggregation. It is useful to be able to predict positions of amyloidogenic regions in protein chains. RESULTS: Two characteristics (expected probability of hydrogen bonds formation and expected packing density of residues) have been introduced by us to detect amyloidogenic regions in a protein sequence. We demonstrate that regions with high expected probability of the formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds as well as regions with high expected packing density are mostly responsible for the formation of amyloid fibrils. Our method (FoldAmyloid) has been tested on a dataset of 407 peptides (144 amyloidogenic and 263 non-amyloidogenic peptides) and has shown good performance in predicting a peptide status: amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic. The prediction based on the expected packing density classified correctly 75\% of amyloidogenic peptides and 74\% of non-amyloidogenic ones. Two variants (averaging by donors and by acceptors) of prediction based on the probability of formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds gave a comparable efficiency. With a hybrid-scale constructed by merging the above three scales, our method is correct for 80\% of amyloidogenic peptides and for 72\% of non-amyloidogenic ones. Prediction of amyloidogenic regions in proteins where positions of amyloidogenic regions are known from experimental data has also been done. In the proteins, our method correctly finds 10 out of 11 amyloidogenic regions. AVAILABILITY: The FoldAmyloid server is available at http://antares.protres.ru/fold-amyloid/.},

	abstract = {The degree of similarity in the three-dimensional structures of two proteins can be examined by comparing the patterns of hydrophobicity found in their amino acid sequences. Each type of amino acid residue is assigned a numerical hydrophobicity, and the correlation coefficient rH is computed between all pairs of residues in the two sequences. In tests on sequences from two properly aligned proteins of similar three-dimensional structures, rH is found in the range 0.3 to 0.7. Improperly aligned sequences or unrelated sequences give rH near zero. By considering the observed frequency of amino acid replacements among related structures, a set of optimal matching hydrophobicities (OMHs) was derived. With this set of OMHs, significant correlation coefficients are calculated for similar three-dimensional structures, even though the two sequences contain few identical residues. An example is the two similar folding domains of rhodanese (rH = 0.5). Predictions are made of similar three-dimensional structures for the alpha and beta chains of the various phycobiliproteins, and for delta hemolysin and melittin.},

Our parameters have also been evaluated by hydrophobicity profiles and by transverse hydrophobic moment calculations on cytosolic, secreted, and membranous model proteins, with favorable results. Many of the hydrophobicity parameters for the post- or cotranslationally modified derivatives are of remarkable magnitude, especially those for oligosaccharide-bound Asn and fatty-acylated Cys or amino terminus.

	abstract = {Standard ranges of atomic and residue volumes are computed in 64 highly resolved and well-refined protein crystal structures using the classical Voronoi procedure. Deviations of the atomic volumes from the standard values, evaluated as the volumeZ-scores, are used to assess the quality of protein crystal structures. To score a structure globally, we compute the volumeZ-score root mean square deviation (Z-score rms), which measures the average magnitude of the volume irregularities in the structure. We find that theZ-score rms decreases as the resolution andR-factor improve, consistent with the fact that these improvements generally reflect more accurate models. From theZ-score rms distribution in structures with a given resolution orR-factor, we determine the normal limits inZ-score rms values for structures solved at that resolution orR-factor. Structures whoseZ-score rms exceeds these limits are considered as outliers. Such structures also exhibit unusual stereochemistry, as revealed by other analyses. AbsoluteZ-scores of individual atoms are used to identify problems in specific regions within a protein model. TheseZ-scores correlate fairly well with the atomicB-factors, and atoms having absoluteZ-scores \&gt;3, occur at or near regions in the model where programs such as PROCHECK identify unusual stereochemistry. Atomic volumes, themselves not directly restrained in crystallographic refinement, can thus provide an indepen dent, rather sensitive, measure of the quality of a protein structure. The volume-based structure validation procedures are implemented in the program PROVE (PROtein Volume Evaluation), which is accessible through the World Wide Web.},

The propensities of different protein sequences to aggregate into amyloids, how they are enhanced by pathogenic mutations, the presence of aggregation hot spots stabilizing pathological interactions, the establishing of cross-amyloid interactions between co-aggregating proteins, all rely at the molecular level on the stability of the amyloid cross-beta structure. Our redesigned server, PASTA 2.0, provides a versatile platform where all of these different features can be easily predicted on a genomic scale given input sequences. The server provides other pieces of information, such as intrinsic disorder and secondary structure predictions, that complement the aggregation data. The PASTA 2.0 energy function evaluates the stability of putative cross-beta pairings between different sequence stretches. It was re-derived on a larger dataset of globular protein domains. The resulting algorithm was benchmarked on comprehensive peptide and protein test sets, leading to improved, state-of-the-art results with more amyloid forming regions correctly detected at high specificity.

The equation is based on the assumption that Δhp log P and ΔGsol are all functions of the difference in intermolecular forces between the amino acid and some medium, and the amino acid and water. The parameters were chosen to model the intermolecular forces of interest. Generally the most important factor is αx. This is followed by ν, i, and nH. Least important is σI. ΔGsol depends on α, nH and nn. Hydration numbers depend on i, nH and nn. The hydrophobicity of amino acid side chains is the result of a preference for a nonpolar medium as a increases and for a polar medium as i, nH and σI increase. It is quantitatively accounted for by the model, and no special “hydrophobic bond” need be involved. The results show that log P values for amino acids are composite quantities whose composition is variable.},

This is mainly because proteins that can undergo structural changes, which lead to amyloid formation, are quite diverse and share no obvious sequence or structural homology, despite the structural similarity found in the fibrils. To address these issues, a novel approach based on recursive feature selection and feed-forward neural networks was undertaken to identify key features highly correlated with the self-assembly problem. This approach allowed the identification of seven physicochemical and biochemical properties of the amino acids highly associated with the self-assembly of peptides and proteins into amyloid-like fibrils (normalized frequency of β-sheet, normalized frequency of β-sheet from LG, weights for β-sheet at the window position of 1, isoelectric point, atom-based hydrophobic moment, helix termination parameter at position j+1 and ΔG° values for peptides extrapolated in 0 M urea). Moreover, these features enabled the development of a new predictor (available at  http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/appnn/index.html ) capable of accurately and reliably predicting the amyloidogenic propensity from the polypeptide sequence alone with a prediction accuracy of 84.9 \% against an external validation dataset of sequences with experimental  in vitro , evidence of amyloid formation.},

Amyloid deposition in human tissue—amyloidosis—is associated with a number of diseases including all common dementias and type II diabetes. Considerable progress has been made to understand the mechanisms leading to amyloid formation. It is, however, not yet clear by which mechanisms amyloid and protein aggregates formed on the path to amyloid are cytotoxic. Strategies to prevent protein aggregation and amyloid formation are nevertheless, in many cases, promising and even successful. This review covers research on intervention of amyloidosis and highlights several examples of how inhibition of protein aggregation and amyloid formation has been achieved in practice. For instance, rational design can provide drugs that stabilize a native folded state of a protein, protein engineering can provide new binding proteins that sequester monomeric peptides from aggregation, small molecules and peptides can be designed to block aggregation or direct it into non-cytotoxic paths, and monoclonal antibodies have been developed for therapies towards neurodegenerative diseases based on inhibition of amyloid formation and clearance.},
